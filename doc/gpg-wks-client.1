.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgpg-wks-client\fR is used to send requests to a Web Key
Service provider.  This is usuallay done to upload a key into a Web
Key Directory.

With the \fB--supported\fR command the caller can test whether a
site supports the Web Key Service.  The argument is an arbitray
address in the to be tested domain. For example
\(oq\fIfoo@example.net\fR\(cq.  The command returns success if the Web Key
Service is supported.  The operation is silent; to get diagnostic
output use the option \fB--verbose\fR.

With the \fB--check\fR command the caller can test whether a key
exists for a supplied mail address.  The command returns success if a
key is available.

The \fB--create\fR command is used to send a request for
publication in the Web Key Directory.  The arguments are the
fingerprint of the key and the user id to publish.  The output from
the command is a properly formatted mail with all standard headers.
This mail can be fed to \fBsendmail(8)\fR or any other tool to
actually send that mail.  If \fBsendmail(8)\fR is installed the
option \fB--send\fR can be used to directly send the created
request.  If the provider request a 'mailbox-only' user id and no such
user id is found, \fBgpg-wks-client\fR will try an additional user
id.

The \fB--receive\fR and \fB--read\fR commands are used to
process confirmation mails as send from the service provider.  The
former expects an encrypted MIME messages, the latter an already
decrypted MIME message.  The result of these commands are another mail
which can be send in the same way as the mail created with
\fB--create\fR.

\fBgpg-wks-client\fR is not commonly invoked directly and thus it
is not installed in the bin directory.  Here is an example how it can
be invoked manually to check for a Web Key Directory entry for
\(oq\fIfoo@example.org\fR\(cq:

$(gpgconf --list-dirs libexecdir)/gpg-wks-client --check foo@example.net

.SH OPTIONS

\fBgpg-wks-client\fR understands these options:


.TP
.B  --send
Directly send created mails using the \fBsendmail\fR command.
Requires installation of that command.

.TP
.B  --output \fIfile\fR
.TQ
.B  -o
Write the created mail to \fIfile\fR instead of stdout.  Note that the
value \fB-\fR for \fIfile\fR is the same as writing to stdout.

.TP
.B  --status-fd \fIn\fR
Write special status strings to the file descriptor \fIn\fR.
This program returns only the status messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which
are helpful when the caller uses a double fork approach and can't
easily get the return code of the process.

Enable extra informational output.

.TP
.B  --quiet
Disable almost all informational output.

.TP
.B  --version
Print version of the program and exit.
